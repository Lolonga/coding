Tanzania is located 492 miles from the Equator, the weather depends on the elevation of the area, this gives the coasts of Tanzanian Islands tropical weather ranging from 20-30 Celsius from March to December. The central plateau hosts arid all year around and contains the capital of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, and the northeastern part has temperatures that vary from 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit It also contains Mount Kilimanjaro which is the highest peak in Africa. Tanzania has for seasons Masika (long rainy season) which lasts about March to May, and from May to October two dry seasons cover the country until November to January when a short rainy season returns water to the land. The long rainy season has humid climates which make it ideal for a crop that requires lots of water and a humid climate like maize, wheat, and rice.
